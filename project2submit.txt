
Project 2 Submission

Group Name:   Team 15

When you have completed the project, complete the following form and include it with your project. Include this file as a text file in the folder with your project when you turn it in. 

For the Checkpoint, Describe a sequence of operations to create a new account and log onto the server:

    Click the Create User button to bring you to the create user screen (CreateUserActivity)
    Enter Username and password twice and then click create user
    This calls CreateUserActivity.onCreateUser()
    This calls Cloud.createUser()
    This contacts the server and returns a status of yes if the creation was successful and no if it failed or already exists
    If successful it returns to MainActivity
    Then the user puts in username and password and presses start
    This calls CreateUserActivity.onStart()
    This calls Cloud.loginUser()
    This contacts the server and returns a status of yes if the login was successful and no if it failed
    If successful it navigates to WaitActivity

A functionality checklist will not be provided for the project. Treat this as you would a request from a client and identify what the client requires.
